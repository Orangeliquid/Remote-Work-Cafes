            <p>"We serve baked goods, savory quiches, cookies, and other treats that are made fresh, in-shop daily. We proudly serve locally-roasted, Thunderkiss Coffee in your choice of freshly-brewed drip, espresso-based drinks, pour-over, and cold brew. Coffee not your thing? Try one of our delicious, natural, whole-fruit smoothies, a warm cup of tea or a refreshing Italian soda."</p>
            <h3 class="mb-3">Established in 2015.</h3>
            <p>"I opened The Bexley Coffee Shop in January 2015. I bought the shop from the previous owners and set out to make it my own by bringing in locally-roasted Thunderkiss Coffee and by making a wide variety of baked goods in-house & from scratch each day. I brightened the decor and added seating to create what I hope is a welcoming, comfortable place for people to escape the workplace, gather with friends, or settle in with a good book. I also added cheery patio seating! I am a small business owner who values our community and hope to make a positive contribution to it."</p>

            <p><strong>While this establishment may be on the smaller side, it doesn't diminish the potential for a determined remote worker to thrive in its cozy space. Whether you choose a seat inside or decide to bask in the open air, conducting remote work in this coffee shop is not only achievable but also enhanced by a constant stream of invigorating caffeine. The rustic blue decor envelops patrons in a comforting ambiance, evoking feelings of warmth and contentment. I've discovered that this coffee shop perfectly aligns with my requirements â€” supporting local businesses, serving local coffee, and boasting robust Wi-Fi connectivity. It's a delightful trifecta that caters to both the need for productivity and the enjoyment of a vibrant local atmosphere.</strong></p>
            <p>Side note: The hours of business are limited, so a cup of coffee(or two) and a few hours of work may only be applicable!</p>
