# Remote Work Cafes (RWC)

RWC is a web application built with Flask that offers eight endpoints, six of which are regional locations around Columbus, Ohio that I have reviewed for remote work and coffee! The other endpoints are the homepage and the about page. This web application is somewhat basic but serves as a stepping stone in my journey of learning HTML and CSS.

Side-note: The color scheme is very much experimental!
